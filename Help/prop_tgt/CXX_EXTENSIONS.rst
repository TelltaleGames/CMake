CXX_EXTENSIONS
--------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.
